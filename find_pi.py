"""
Usage:
    ./find_pi.py

Tries to find the IP address of any Raspberry Pi
that is on the network served by the <INTERFACE>
and with in the <IP_RANGE> specified (see below.)

This script uses `sudo` to run `arp-scan` and so
in most environments you will be asked to enter
your sudoer's password.

It is known/assumed that the first half of the
MAC addresses of the the eth0 interface of
all RPis are the same (<MAC_FIRST_HALF>.)

To be useful, you'll have to customize by editing
the 'INTERFACE' and 'IP_RANGE' variables/constants
to conform to your particular use case. (See comments
below for some guidance. The result of the 
$ ifconfig
command will help.)

The output consists of a header and then (if found)
the IP address(es) of any Raspberry Pi that might be
on the network.
