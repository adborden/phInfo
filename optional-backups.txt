### OPTIONAL

For testing purposes, I've been using a very small SD card: only 4GB. 
What follows would NOT be feasible when using a high capacity card.

Several of the steps outlined in the README take a long time,
especially if the quality of your Internet connection is less than you
might wish.  During testing, there fore, I've been doing a back up
after each such step so that if there is a failure, I don't have to
begin from the beginning to test a corrected version of a failed
command. 

Each time such a step completes successfully I shutdown the target:

        sudo shutdown -h now

... and then power it down; on the `Pi` simply pull out the micro
USB power cord. After moving the SD card into the card reader of
the staging machine an image can be made.  The following code is
provided to modify and use (copy and paste is very helpful) as
appropriate.  Be sure you understand any code you choose to run!


export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sdb"
export IMAGE="2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img"
export DeviceName="sde"
export IMAGE="2017-09-07-stretch-after-upgrade.img"


# after-upgrade
From card (device) to file (image):
sudo dd of="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" if=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

From file (image) to card:
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export IMAGE="2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img"
export DeviceName="sdb"
sudo dd if="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" of=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

# Stretch image to card
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sde"
export IMAGE="2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img"
sudo dd if="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" of=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

# Save image after 1st curl command:
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sdb"
export IMAGE="after1stcurl.img"
umount /dev/${DeviceName}1
umount /dev/${DeviceName}2
rm "${DLDir}/${IMAGE}"
sudo dd of="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" if=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

# Restore card after 1st curl command:
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sdb"
export IMAGE="after1stcurl.img"
umount /dev/${DeviceName}1
umount /dev/${DeviceName}2
sudo dd if="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" of=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

#card after 2nd curl command:
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sdb"
export IMAGE="after2ndcurl.img"
umount /dev/${DeviceName}1
umount /dev/${DeviceName}2
sudo dd of="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" if=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync

#card after favourites.sh command:
export DLDir="/Downloads"
export DeviceName="sdb"
export IMAGE="afterfavourites.img"
umount /dev/${DeviceName}1
umount /dev/${DeviceName}2
sudo dd of="${DLDir}/${IMAGE}" if=/dev/$DeviceName bs=4M && sudo sync
